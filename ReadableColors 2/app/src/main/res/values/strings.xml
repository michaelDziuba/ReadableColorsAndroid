        The purpose of this app is to help you find colored backgrounds for black or white text.\n\n

        It\'s based on W3C standards and formula for contrast ratio between text and background. W3C recommends the following minimum standards:\n\n

        For normal text less than 18 point and for bold text less than 14 point, the minimum contrast ratio is 7:1.  For normal text at least 18 point and for bold text at least 14 point, the minimum contrast ratio is 4.5:1.  For logos, decorative text, and large scale text, the minimum contrast ratio is 3:1.\n\n
